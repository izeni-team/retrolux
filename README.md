## Retrolux 1.0 ##

**Why Retrolux?**

Retroluxâ€™s primary goal is to become an alternative to Retrofit, but for Swift. It will promote a strongly-flavored workflow, in order to increase programmer efficiency. Being adaptable and modular by design, it will also allow for a variety of workflows and plugins. This should drastically reduce the amount of code that has to be written for client applications to make network requests.

Jake Wharton, the author of Retrofit, has stated that he has no plans to create a Retrofit-like framework for iOS. However, even though Retrofit uses reflection and runtime features not present in Swift, alternatives solutions exist which make it possible to have just as concise of an API in Swift as is possible in Java and Retrofit. Prior attempts have been either in Objective-C, are incomplete, or are simply workflow built on top of existing frameworks.

The most popular networking frameworks for iOS, as of November 2017, are Alamofire and AFNetworking, both of which have workflows that are very different than Retrofit. Considering that there is no mature open source implementation of a Retrofit-like workflow written in Swift, and that Retrofit is the most popular networking framework for Android, and that the most starred Swift project on GitHub is Alamofire, it stands to reason that a Retrofit-like framework for Swift could be a valuable contribution to the open source community.

Currently, Retrolux exists as an impartial, work-in-progress prototype. It is a bit more than a proof of concept, because the old, pre-1.0 version is being used in a few apps already, but it is also a long ways away from Retrofit in terms of features and customizability.
